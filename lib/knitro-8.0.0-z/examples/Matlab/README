Using KNITRO with Matlab(R)
---------------------------

This directory contains example code illustrating how to call KNITRO from the 
Matlab language using the "ktrlink" interface.

NOTE: The KNITRO/Matlab link "ktrlink" requires Matlab release R2008a
or later including Optimization Toolbox, as well as a valid KNITRO
installation (version 5.2 or later).

exampleNLP1.m         A Matlab example code illustrating how to solve a
                      small nonlinear optimization model using the KNITRO 
                      Mex interface "ktrlink".

exampleQP1.m          A Matlab example code illustrating how to solve a
                      small quadratic programming (QP) model using the KNITRO 
                      Mex interface "ktrlink".

exampleLP1.m          A Matlab example code illustrating how to solve a
                      small linear programming (LP) model using the KNITRO 
                      Mex interface "ktrlink".

qpoptions.opt         A sample KNITRO input file of user options that are
                      often ideal for quadratic programming (QP) models.
                      Contents can be modified using any text-based editor. The
                      file can be passed as the last parameter to "ktrlink".

                      Contents can be modified using any text-based editor. The
                      file can be passed as the last parameter to "ktrlink".

knitro.opt            A sample KNITRO input file complete a complete list of 
                      user options.  Contents can be modified using any 
                      text-based editor.  The file can be passed as the last 
                      parameter to "ktrlink".


Installation
------------

1) Make sure a Ziena license for KNITRO is properly installed.  See Section 2.2
   of "ZienaLicenseMgr_UserManual.pdf" provided in the "doc" directory of this
   distribution for instructions on installing a KNITRO license.  There are
   several options for installing the license file.  The easiest is typically 
   to put the license file whose name begins with "ziena_lic" in your "$HOME" 
   or "$HOME/.ziena/" directory.

2) In order to use ktrlink, you need to tell MATLAB where the KNITRO shared 
   object library ("libknitro.so", "libknitro.so.8" or similar file) resides.  
   To do this, set the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the 
   "lib" directory holding the KNITRO libraries via the command:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<full_path_to_knitro_lib_directory>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   
   or

    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <full_path_to_knitro_lib_directory>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

NOTE: Matlab releases R2008a, R2008b, and R2009a expect the KNITRO library file 
      on Linux to be named "libknitro.so.5". Matlab releases R2009b, R2010a, and 
      R2010b expect the KNITRO library file on Linux to be named "libknitro.so.6".
      Matlab releases R2011a, R2011b and R2012a expect the KNITRO library file on 
      Linux to be named "libknitro.so.7".	

      To use KNITRO 8.x or later with Matlab release R2008a through 2011b, you 
      must simply make a copy of the KNITRO shared object library provided, and 
      rename it appropriately (if a copy of this name does not already exist),
      or create a symbolic link to the expected name.  For example, in the KNITRO 
      library directory, issue the command:

        ln -s libknitro.so.8.0.0 libknitro.so.5

      for Matlab releases R2008a, R2008b, or R2009a, or

        ln -s libknitro.so.8.0.0 libknitro.so.6

      for Matlab releases R2009b, R2010a, or R2010b or

        ln -s libknitro.so.8.0.0 libknitro.so.7

      for Matlab releases R2011a, R2011b, or R2012a to allow the KNITRO 8.0.0 
      distribution to work with Matlab releases R2008a through R2011b.

3) Once the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is set correctly, close and 
   re-open Matlab.  To test whether your installation was successful, type in 
   the expression

      [x fval] = ktrlink(@(x)cos(x),1)

   at the Matlab command prompt. If your installation was successful, ktrlink
   returns x = 3.1416, fval = -1.
  
   To run the examples provided in this directory, just type "exampleNLP1", for
   example, at a Matlab  prompt to run the example "exampleNLP1.m".
