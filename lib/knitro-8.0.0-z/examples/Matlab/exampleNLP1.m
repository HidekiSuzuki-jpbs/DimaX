% Example problem formulated as an Matlab model used to
% demonstate using the KNITRO ktrlink Mex interface with Matlab.
% The problem is
%
%     minimize    1000 - x1^2 - 2*x2^2 - x3^2 - x1*x2 - x1*x3
%     subject to  8*x1 + 14*x2 + 7*x3         = 56
%                 -(x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 - 25) <= 0
%                 0 <= (x1, x2, x3) <= 10
%
% and has two local solutions:
%   the point (0,0,8) with objective 936.0, and
%   the point (7,0,0) with objective 951.0
