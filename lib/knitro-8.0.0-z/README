The KNITRO 8.0 distribution offers the following interfaces:

- Ampl
- C/C++
- Fortran

To use KNITRO with the Ampl modeling language, you must have a valid
Ampl license.  A "knitroampl" executable file, an example Ampl model
and instructions for using KNITRO with Ampl are provided in the
"knitroampl" directory.      

To use the KNITRO callable library API with a programming language
(e.g., C/C++, Fortran, Java), go inside the "examples" directory and

interface language you intend to use.  These examples include all the
key features necessary to use the KNITRO callable library API.

To use KNITRO with the Matlab language, you must have a valid
Matlab installation (release R2008a or later) including Optimization 
Toolbox.  Example Matlab models and instructions for using KNITRO with 
Matlab are provided in the "examples/Matlab" directory.
