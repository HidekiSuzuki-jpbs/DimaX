KNITRO 8.0
----------

For KNITRO to be activated and run on your machine, you must first
obtain and install a valid license file from Ziena or your local
distributor.  These instructions describe a simple procedure for
installing stand-alone, single-computer licenses on a Linux or Unix platform.
For network licensing, or more stand-alone license options, please consult
the Ziena License Manager user manual.     

Stand-alone/Single Computer Licensing
-------------------------------------

For a single machine license, execute "get_machine_ID", a program
supplied with the distribution.  This will generate a machine ID (five
pairs of hexadecimal digits). Email the machine ID to info@ziena.com
if purchased through Ziena. (If KNITRO was purchased through a
distributor, then email the machine ID to your local distributor.)
Ziena (or your local distributor) will then send a license file of the
form "ziena_lic_name.txt".  The file name is arbitrary, so long as it
begins with "ziena_lic".  The license file is made available to KNITRO
on a Linux or Unix platform in any one of the following ways: 

- Put "ziena_lic_name.txt" in your $HOME directory.
- Put "ziena_lic_name.txt" in the directory in which you run KNITRO.
- Set the environment variable ZIENA_LICENSE to the location of the file
    (e.g.,  export ZIENA_LICENSE=/home/subdirectory/ziena_lic_name.txt).
