Linking KNITRO 8.0 Libraries for 64-bit Linux
---------------------------------------------

This directory contains the 64-bit Linux KNITRO libraries.  The
KNITRO 8.0 libraries for 64-bit Linux implement parallel features 
using OpenMP.  These libraries are built using gcc 4.4 and glibc 2.5.
In order to use these libraries, you must have a newer installation 
of Linux that is compatible for linking against these libraries.

If you have an older installation of Linux that is not compatible
with these libraries, then you can use the older libraries provided
in the "gcc34-sequential" subdirectory.  These libraries DO NOT use OpenMP
and thus do not implement any of the parallel features in KNITRO.
The "sequential" libraries are built using gcc 3.4.2 with glibc 2.3.4.

If you are unable to link against both of these libraries, then
please contact your KNITRO distributor to see if they can provide a
version of KNITRO for 64-bit Linux that is compatible with your
system.
